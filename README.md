# Advent of Code

This repository contains a set of solutions to the problems published by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz) for his yearly [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) event.

The repository contains a mixture of different programming languages used including Java, PHP and Python. Solutions are made to read from `stdin` and output to `stdout`.
